A detailed overview of machine learning, its types, and a brief description of common algorithms in each category.


What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML algorithms identify patterns in data and improve their performance as they are exposed to more data over time.


Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning is typically categorized into three main types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

1. Supervised Learning
Overview: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can predict labels for new, unseen data.


Common Algorithms:


a). Linear Regression: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.

b). Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification tasks; predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular category.

c). Decision Trees: A tree-like model used for classification and regression that splits the data into subsets based on feature values.

d). Random Forest: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for improved accuracy and robustness.

e). Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space, used for classification tasks.

f). Neural Networks: Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data through layers, capable of modeling complex relationships.
